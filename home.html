            <h2>Arlo is a purebred mutt.</h2>
            <p>When I first got Arlo from the shelter, we were told he was a labrador retriever. After a DNA test, I learned that he is actually 40% pitbull terrier, 20% golden retreiver, and the rest is other random breeds.</p>

            <h2>Arlo has lots of energy.</h2>
            <p>He is not very good at fetch, but he loves to chase after small critters and his oversized cat toy.</p>

            <h2>Arlo loves his family.</h2>
            <p>Arlo always gets excited to go visit his (human) grandparents and loves to snuggle.</p>

            <h2>Arlo is not a very big fan of water.</h2>
            <p>Despite being a medium/large breed, Arlo does not really like to go anywhere near the water. I am slowly introducing him to the ocean, since he does like to walk down to the beach.</p>
